                         CATOTA MEDIA PLAYER
                         ===================

Catota  is the  brazilian  slang  for "snot"  (Mucus  secreted in,  or
discharged from, the nose. -- Webster).

Catota is  an experience with multimedia and  Maemo devices, specially
N800. It's  a dirty hack, hence  the name, to allow  trying new player
engines  and  data  sources,  yet providing  a  beautiful/useful  user
interface.

It provides  both client and server,  where server is just  a TCP HTTP
server with built in media transcoders,  meant to be run on desktop or
servers and  client is  a Python/GTK UI  with some player  engine like
MPlayer and dialogs to interact with data sources.
